## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Caleb Lugo and I am a junior in highschool. This is my first time using github or anything related to ai besides ChatGPT. Outside of school I like to play soccer with my friends and go outside. One highlight of summer that I did was go to a bears game. They won 38-0 and look like they could be a playoff team. I am looking forward to learning how to use ai to help with different tasks. One thing that people don't know about me is that I am on the rowing team. I joined the team freshman year and have stayed on. My favorite artist is Drake.
